1. create interface for:
    1. Task
    2. Queue
    3. QueueFactoryOptions
2. create queue factory
  2.1 that that take params: initialState and params
  2.2 which will consist from two methods:
    2.2.1 handleLoop - cut head and the rest of queue, start process callback and handle onSucceed and onFailed
    2.2.2 startQueue - we create once "concurrency" array and start main function handleLoop
3. create external callbacks for queue handling:
  3.1 handleJob: console, return promise
  3.1 onSucceed: push to the result, process specific keys and console
  3.1 onFailed: console
